Chat server/client

            Your client should:

            console.log a ‘connected’ message when it has successfully connected to the server

                                                   console.log any messages received from the server.

                                                   Forward input from stdin

                                                   Your server should:

                                                   Uniquely identify every new client connection.

                                                   When a new client connects:

                                                   Send a welcome message to the newly connected client

                                                   Send a notification to all other clients indicating that a new user has connected

                                                                              Log the connection message to a chat.log file

                                                                              When a client sends a message:

                                                                              Rebroadcast the client’s message to all clients (excluding the client that sent the message), include the name of the client
                                                                                                                                                                            that sent the message. E.g. Client1: Hi All!

                                                                                                                                                                            Log the message to chat.log

                                                                                                                                                                            When a client disconnects your server should:

                                                                                                                                                                            Remove the client from the list of connected clients

                                                                                                                                                                            Send a notification to all other clients indicating that the user has disconnected

                                                                                                                                                                                                       Log the disconnection message to chat.log
